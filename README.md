This project showcases the creation of an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel, providing comprehensive insights into sales performance. The process began with data extraction, where raw sales data was collected from various sources. Next, the data underwent cleaning and preprocessing using Power Query Editor, including tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure data accuracy. Through data transformation in Power Query, calculated fields were added, columns were categorized, and the data was reshaped for effective analysis. The project then progressed to data modeling, where relationships between tables were established using Power Pivot to create a robust data model for seamless analysis. Advanced data analysis was conducted using Pivot Tables and DAX Measures to derive actionable insights. Finally, the dashboard was designed with interactive slicers, charts, and key performance indicators to visualize trends such as revenue by occasion, product performance, seasonal trends, and city-wise order distribution. This project highlights the use of Excelâ€™s advanced features for end-to-end sales data analysis and empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions.
